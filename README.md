# üìà Stock Market Prediction System

This project is a **Machine Learning-based Stock Market Price Prediction System** that forecasts stock price trends using historical data and technical indicators. It features a responsive front-end built with HTML/CSS and a robust Python-based back-end implementing data preprocessing, model training, and real-time prediction.

## üîç Features

- Predicts stock price trends using **Linear Regression** and **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** models.
- **Data preprocessing** and **feature engineering** using Python libraries like Pandas and NumPy.
- Real-time prediction with user input and dynamic stock chart rendering.
- **Front-end** interface built with **HTML** and **CSS** for user interaction.
- Clean, modular, and well-documented code for maintainability.
- Published in a peer-reviewed journal *(ISSN: 1869-9391)* for its innovation and real-world applicability.
